            <h2>What gave this a start?</h2>
            <p>Our team's journey with NovaRec began with a love all three of us share— books. As three bibliophiles, we bonded over literature and formed a beautiful friendship through countless discussions about our favourite novels. However, this shared love for reading also exposed us to a common frustration that many avid readers face—the difficulty of discovering our next great read.  </p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>NovaRec was born from our desire to solve this problem—not just for ourselves, but for readers everywhere. By developing a novel recommendation system that analyses book similarities intelligently, NovaRec helps readers discover their next favourite book without the frustration and time investment we experienced. It transforms the challenge of "What should I read next?" into an exciting journey.</p>
